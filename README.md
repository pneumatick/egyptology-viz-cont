# Proposal for the continuation of Brown University's Egyptology Visualization Project

## Background
This project aims to implement one or more tools to visualize the evolution of pyramid building during the Pyramid Age (2700â€“1700 BCE). By showing novel visualizations about pyramids, and allowing the user to customize various parameters, it seeks to offer an updated and broader understanding of societal development during this period, addressing the gaps and omissions of past visualizations that have predominantly focused on linear interpretations centered on kings and the structural characteristics of the pyramids. This initiative will generate new charts and infographics for inclusion in an academic publication, providing a comprehensive overview of the development of funerary constructions and their significance through time.

## Goals
- Generate plots related to the status, length of rule, gender (including kings, queens, and other individuals) of pyramid complexes through time and space.
- Create updated images based on the ones present in our repository (currently private) which are from 1997. The current images focus exclusively on the pyramids of kings, and they miss other significant developments, such as the expansion of the mortuary temples, areas for decoration, and the evolution of miniature pyramid complexes for queens, among others.
- Combine charts, plots, and information into an infographic that tells a story.
- Optionally, the publication of all datasets and tools used in this project for public use.

## Progress
- Created, largely normalized dataset of Old Kingdom pyramids
- Created a script to normalize incoming datasets
- Described the dataset in a dedicated codebook
- Performed a cursory analysis of the dataset
- Created a number of visuals of the data in the dataset
- Set up a package management system to facilitate collaborative workflows over time

## Work To Be Completed
- Complete normalization of Old Kingdom pyramid dataset
- Create infographic/interactive visuals of the Old Kingdom pyramid data
- Create dataset(s) of pyramid complex structures other than the pyramids themselves, such as mortuary temples, areas for decoration, etc.
- Perform analysis of previously mentioned dataset(s)
- Create visuals of the data in the previously mentioned dataset(s)
